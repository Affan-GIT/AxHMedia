    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      AXH Media is committed to protecting your privacy. We understand the
      importance of privacy, transparency, and trust when it comes to handling
      personal data. This policy outlines how we use, collect, and share
      information that we gather from you or that you provide to us when you use
      our services, or when you interact with us or our authorized partners.
    </p>
    <h2>Scope</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy applies to all entities within AXH Media, including
      our social media platforms, websites, applications, products, and
      services.
    </p>
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      We collect two types of information: Personally Identifiable Information
      (PII) and Non-Personally Identifiable Information (Non-PII). PII may
      include your name, email address, contact details, and any other
      information that could be used to identify you. Non-PII refers to
      information that does not identify you personally, like your browser type,
      device type, or the pages you visit.
    </p>
    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>
      We use your information to provide, improve, and personalize our services.
      This includes data analysis, research, and audit purposes. We may also use
      your information to communicate with you about our services, provide you
      with customer support, or to comply with legal obligations.
    </p>
    <h2>Disclosure of Information</h2>
    <p>
      We may share your information with our partners, vendors, and affiliates
      in order to provide our services. We also may disclose your information if
      required by law or in response to a legal process.
    </p>
    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      AXH Media takes appropriate technical and organizational measures to
      protect your personal data against unauthorized or unlawful processing and
      against accidental loss, destruction, or damage.
    </p>
    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      We use cookies and similar technologies to provide our services,
      understand how you use our services, and to improve your experience. You
      have the ability to accept or decline cookies.
    </p>
    <h2>Employee Access to Data</h2>
    <p>
      We ensure that access to your personal data is restricted to employees who
      need it to perform their job functions. We require all employees with such
      access to follow strict contractual confidentiality obligations.
    </p>
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      This policy does not apply to services offered by other companies or
      individuals, including products or sites that may be displayed to you in
      search results, or other sites linked from our services. We do not control
      the privacy policies of our business partners, which may be different than
      ours.
    </p>
    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain personal data for as long as necessary to provide our services
      or for other essential purposes such as complying with legal obligations,
      resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements.
    </p>
    <h2>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current
      version of the policy will govern our processing of your personal data and
      will always be available on our website.
    </p>
