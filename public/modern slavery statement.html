    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      AXH Media unequivocally denounces all forms of slavery, human trafficking,
      and forced labor. We are dedicated to ensuring that our business
      operations, along with our global supply chains, are free from any sort of
      modern slavery or exploitation. Our commitment extends to all our
      employees, contractors, clients, partners, and users.
    </p>
    <h2>Scope</h2>
    <p>
      This Modern Slavery Statement applies to all entities within AXH Media and
      is relevant to all our employees, suppliers, partners, and contractors.
      This is in accordance with the Modern Slavery Act of 2015 and is valid for
      the financial year ending in 2023.
    </p>
    <h2>Policies and Contractual Controls</h2>
    <p>
      We have put in place a variety of policies that ensure that we comply with
      all relevant legislation, and more importantly, maintain our commitment to
      human rights, dignity, and fairness. Our Employee Code of Conduct outlines
      the behavior we expect from all our staff, promoting ethical practices,
      mutual respect, and the assurance of a safe and healthy work environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Supplier Code of Conduct expects similar standards from all our
      suppliers, especially those providing freelance content creation, digital
      design services, social media monitoring tools, or other digital products
      and services. We require our partners to confirm their adherence to our
      code and to national and international laws related to labor rights.
    </p>
    <h2>Due Diligence and Risk Assessment</h2>
    <p>
      We understand that sectors involving digital labor, such as social media
      marketing, have the potential to harbor hidden forms of modern slavery.
      Therefore, AXH Media takes rigorous measures to identify and mitigate this
      risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      We conduct a thorough due diligence process before partnering with any
      third-party agencies, influencers, freelancers, or data providers. This
      involves checking their own modern slavery statements, compliance with
      labor laws, and overall ethical conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our risk assessment process also takes into consideration the geographical
      regions of our partners. Regions with high instances of human rights
      abuses are flagged, and business engagements in these areas are strictly
      scrutinized or avoided altogether.
    </p>
    <h2>Training</h2>
    <p>
      At AXH Media, we believe that awareness and education are key to combating
      modern slavery. All our employees receive regular training on modern
      slavery, human trafficking, and labor rights. We ensure they can recognize
      potential instances of modern slavery and understand the proper course of
      action if such issues arise.
    </p>
    <h2>Reporting and Whistleblowing</h2>
    <p>
      We encourage our employees and partners to report any concerns about
      modern slavery through our Whistleblowing Policy. This policy protects
      whistleblowers from any form of retaliation and ensures that all reported
      instances are thoroughly investigated.
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      At AXH Media, we believe in an ethical, fair, and transparent digital
      world. We are fully committed to combating modern slavery in all its forms
      and will continually assess our practices to ensure they remain effective.
    </p>
    <p>
      This statement was approved by our Board of Directors and will be reviewed
      annually to maintain its relevance and effectiveness.
